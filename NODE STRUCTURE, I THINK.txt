What to do if the player nears a node.

 - Direct the player to the next node
		OR
 - Make the player look around or at something

Every single event must be in a stack and should have a duration. These nodes
can also affect the speed of the character.

Example of a node's stack: -
EVENT NAME		EVENT PARAMS		EVENT DURATION
look			Y + 20 degrees		500ms
walk			forward, speed=1	250ms
exit			nil			nil (0ms)

========================================

EVENT LIST

"look"
Param: rotation (camera X rotation, player Y rotation, camera Z rotation)

"walk"
Params: direction, player speed
(Is direction really required? I'm better off having a node for smaller movements
and what not.)

"exit" simply assigns the next node for the player to move to.

"stop" stops the player for a set duration.

========================================

Could use more to work with.
